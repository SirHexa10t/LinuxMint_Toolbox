You might have trouble installing on the first try because of failed bootloader write, trying again solves it
	I don't know if it's relevant, but 2nd time I tried, I marked the volume I wanted to install into (it had a checkbox))


Audio
=====
Lower sound from 100% to 30%

Go to Sound:
    disable sound for "Tiling and snapping windows"
	enable "Opening new windows"
	enable "Showing notifications"

Display
=======
Go to Display:
    First choose the primary display and apply
    Then sort the screens as needed
    For some reason there's an offset that's solved when the right and top monitors are redefined to resolution "1680 x 1050 (16:10)"
    Change refresh rate of the ASUS screen

GUI (mostly ricing)
===
Go to Welcome > First Steps
    Set night mode and default color

Go to Timeshift -> create a snapshots schedule at boot, set 10 snapshots to keep ( TODO: see if it snapshots packages and OS preferences )
    Create a snapshot (takes a split-second) 

Right-click > Customize > Desktop Settings -> enable everything

Go to System Settings >
    Preferences > Panel
        Add a Panel to the top screen (will be used to list windows - the "navigation" screen)
            Right-click the panel > Applets
                -> add "Menu"
                -> add "Scale"
                -> add "Grouped Window list"
                right-click the panel and activate edit-mode to drag items to the left if necessary
            Right-click the panel > Preferences > Configure -> make it show all running windows
            Right-click > System Settings -> pin to the Panel
            Lookup "Timeshift" in the Menu of this Panel and pin it
        On the panel of the main screen: (will be used to manage operations and access misc stuff)
            Remove "show desktop"
            activate edit mode
            right-click > Applets
                -> "Grouped window list", "Menu", "Favorites", "Calendar", "Keyboard", "Network Manager", "Notifications", "Power Manager", "Printers", "Sound", "XApp Status Applet" should already exist
                -> Add "Removable drives
                -> optional: add "expo" to manage several desktops... probably not
                -> optional: in Download -> add "QRedshift" to make the screen warmer at night
                -> optional: in Download -> see what other things could interest you
           right-click the Calendar (bottom-right corner) > configure > Use a custom date format -> use this format: "%Y-%m-%d%n(%a)%X" (or maybe skip the %a (day name, shortened))
    
    Right-click any icon on the Panel (taskbar) (while not in Panel Edit mode) > Applet Preferences > Configure...
        Mouse wheel scroll action -> Cycle windows
        Left click action -> Cycle windows
        (do the following once it'll work properly newly-added instances through mouse-wheel click don't appear in the icon's window list) Middle click action -> Launch new app instance

    Preferences > Hot Corners -> enable bottom-right corner and set it to show the desktop after 200ms delay (it's not the most convenient corner, but consistent for Windows users)
    
    Preferences > Window Tiling -> enable maximizing when dragging to top edge (consistent for Windows users)

    Preferences > General -> check if it's acceptable. I arbitrarily set the RAM limit to 4096.
    
    Preferences > Notifications ->
        enable
        remove after timeout
        not at bottom
        OSD size: Small. 

    Preferences > Languages
        -> set Language to "English, United States"
        -> Apply System-Wide

    Preferences > Windows > Behavior ->
        have Window focus mode set to either "Click" or "Sloppy" ("Mouse" won't let you launch a terminal and type on it without the cursor on it)
        Activate "Bring windows which require attention to the current workspace" 
        set "Special key to move and resize windows" to "Super" (to allow alt-clicking in various IDEs)

    Preferences > Screensaver -> toggle off "Lock the computer after screensaver starts"

    Hardware > Keyboard > Shortcuts
        > System > Lock screen -> Set CTRL+ESC instead of CTRL+ALT+L (which is PyCharm's "sort this page" shortcut)
        > Launchers > Launch terminal > Add Super+Return (Super=Windows-key, Return=Enter)
        > Launchers > Home folder > Set Super+H instead of Super+E (Super=Windows-key)

    Hardware > Keyboard > Layouts -> add your extra languages
        -> Options... > Switching to another layout -> choose a keyboard shortcut (maybe ALT+SHIFT for consistency with Windows)
        if you want to input Kanji, go to Preferences > Input Method

    Hardware > Power Management -> see that the settings are acceptable
    

Set bigger default terminal size: 
    Open Terminal
    if you don't see top menu, right-click in it and check "Show Menubar"
    Edit > Initial terminal size: 120 columns, 36 rows

Set Xed (text editor) to use a different theme, because its .sh editor is barely readable 
    Of the default options I find "Oblivion" or "Solarized Dark" to be the most tolerable
    If you want to use Monokai style, the steps are:
        Download/save-to-xml a monokai coloring scheme (can be found here for example): https://github.com/trusktr/gedit-color-schemes/blob/master/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/Monokai.xml
        In Xed, go to Edit > Preferences > Theme -> '+' button -> (browse for the monokai file)
        Still in the themes menu, choose the Monokai one, see how it changes your files' look.
    If you want to use Darcula style, the steps are:
        Download/save-to-xml a darcula coloring scheme (can be found here for example): https://gist.github.com/natanfelles/ae1a176a92c6a2404518498c77c48696
        In Xed, go to Edit > Preferences > Theme -> '+' button -> (browse for the darcula file)
        Still in the themes menu, choose the Darcula one, see how it changes your files' look.
    
Template: Add a new shell file option to right-click:
    bs="$HOME/Templates/bash_script.sh"
    touch "$bs" && chmod ug+x "$bs" && printf '#!/bin/bash\n\n' > "$bs"
Template: Add a new text file (non-executable) option to right-click:
    pt="$HOME/Templates/plain_text.txt"
    touch "$pt" && chmod 664 "$pt"

# the following scripts are added on right-click menu. The script is run at current location without args, unless right-clicked a file, then the script get the filename (just the name, no path) as one arg
    scripts_dir="$HOME/.local/share/nemo/scripts"
    ln -s "$scripts_dir" "$HOME/scripts"  # create shortcut (soft link) for easier access in the future. To make future scripts take effect immediately, follow the link to the path instead of just opening it. Also refresh that folder.
Script: Write file/folder name as a memo for later, in "handle_later.txt" at HOME:
    scripts_dir="$HOME/.local/share/nemo/scripts"
    memo_file="$scripts_dir/memo"
    echo -e '#!/bin/sh\necho "File of interest: $(date +%Y-%m-%d_%T) $(pwd)/$1" >> "$HOME/handle_later.txt"' > "$memo_file" && chmod +x "$memo_file"

Check that you have internet connection
    If not, disconnect and reconnect; it might solve the problem
Go to Firewall -> enable it (still no rules, but at least it'll block incoming for now)
    Deny incoming
    See that you can still browse the internet    


Go to Timeshift -> create a snapshots
Open Terminal and run a system update (will take a while):
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo shutdown -r now


installations:

follow QEMU installation file's instructions





Run the apt_installations.sh file


In VSCode/VSCodium:
    # cancel the tab deletion in empty lines:
        go to  File > Preferences > Settings
        look for "editor.trimAutoWhitespace" and set it to false (uncheck it)
        

# not working well:   enable session-saving: run 'dconf-editor' and go to org > cinnamon > cinnamon-session -> turn on 'auto-save-session'


With the new Nvidia drivers installed, configure display layout and refresh rates:
    NVIDIA Settings > X Server Display Configuration
        Set layout
        change the resolution from auto, so that 2nd field becomes editable for frequency
        Save to a file (can't save to the default one - nvidia's driver won't write nor read it):
            Click "Save to X Configuration file"
            Click "Show Preview" copy the contents, save somewhere
            edit "/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc" (or in some other systems could be in $HOME) to include the line "nvidia-settings --load-config-only &" before the only line that's already in there (a source of X11 session)
    maybe you could just "help" it by running the screen settings as sudo ( sudo nvidia-settings ) 
        maybe you need to chown the file it's trying to access...
    Make sure that the Startup Application "NVIDIA X Server Settings" doesn't have this command:    sudo -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-settings --load-config-only'
        if it does, simplify it to:    /usr/bin/nvidia-settings --load-config-only

Enable starting a terminal at current window (works for nemo file manager):
    run: mkdir -p "${HOME}/.gnome2/accels"
    run: touch "${HOME}/.gnome2/accels/nemo"
    reset cinnamon by logging out/in (CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE)
        the created file will now have many commented configuration lines
    uncomment and set key for the line that has "OpenInTerminal". run these commands:
        keyshortcut='<Primary><Shift>t'  # only line you might want to change, the rest stay the same  # "Ctrl" is "Primary"
        original_line='; (gtk_accel_path "<Actions>/DirViewActions/OpenInTerminal" "")'
        replace_line='(gtk_accel_path "<Actions>/DirViewActions/OpenInTerminal" "'$keyshortcut'")'
        sed -i "s|${original_line}|${replace_line}|g" "${HOME}/.gnome2/accels/nemo"  # replace string
    reset cinnamon again by logging out/in (CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE)


update the /etc/bash.bashrc file with own baschrc definitions (or reference)


The GUI in 'System Settings > Hardware > Disks' is neat. Remember to use it in the future if you need device-id or status.













TODO
setup things through systemd (init system)
check xorg display server options


TODO
go over the ungoogling-folder and install some of those things


TODO
Go to System Settings > Preferences > Preferred Applications

Go to System Settings > Preferences > Startup Applications -> see that everything there makes sense to launch at startup


TODO
go over programs in X/programs_and_images  and see that no type of program is missing from this OS (like 3D prints editor or DAC drivers or VR software...)



Unresolved: noises before startup (from DAC?), when the logo just appears  - probably from DAC, maybe JDS's drivers would solve that

Unresolved: install programs like in old OSs, install basic stuff like image-viewer, go over scripts in X

Unresolved: make the OS open txt file in editor, not ask if it needs to run



Not sure: update and upgrade everything

# Careful, this'll take a while
