OpenSUSE Tumbleweed - rolling versions, but still stable. Can switch flavors easily!

Fedora - Highly polished, just works. Solid choice in most ways

RedHat/CentOS - stable (business)

Ubuntu - user friendly (again, after failing at it for a while)

Arch - custom-tailored ; runs specifically on your hardware (marginally faster than other distros), comes with minimal installations
    Known to be less stabel

Kali - basically a network and penetration-testing platform

Gentoo - Like Arch but more extreme 

Alpine - very light and minimalistic (supports run-from-RAM), great for microservices and dockerized server stuff

NixOS - ?
