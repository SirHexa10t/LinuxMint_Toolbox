Basically there are 3 primary groups of desktop distros (which use different package managers): Debian (apt), Arch (pacman), Fedora (dnf)
Some distros come with specially-made UI and customization options, and of-course the maintainers (and their servers) differ too


Debian - simplicity. Has a large community and common program support/compatibility
    Ubuntu - user-friendly, basic/beginner experience on GNOME
        Mint - customized with a lot of tools and a few distinct systems
        Pop!OS - basically a slightly more beginner-friendly Mint-like?
        Elementary OS - stylish. Mouse (non-terminal) oriented. Requires recent hardware and at-least medium-spec hardware
        Kubuntu - flavor rather than distro; running on KDE Plasma (instead of GNOME)
        Lubuntu - flavor rather than distro; runinng on LXQt (instead of GNOME). Very lightwedight 
        Xubuntu - flavor rather than distro; runinng on Xfce (instead of GNOME). Very lightwedight 
    SteamOS 1 / 2 - a game library
    Kali - basically a network and penetration-testing platform


Red Hat - stable; business-oriented
    Fedora - Highly polished, just works. Solid choice in most ways
    CentOS - stability/security-focused (on expense of updates). Used often on servers
    RHEL - Enterprise Linux, used often on servers


Arch - custom-tailored, meant to be personally-configured ; runs specifically on your hardware (marginally faster than other distros). Known to be less stable
    EndeavourOS - possibly the best Arch distro, according to someone on youtube
    Garuda - use-friendly and polished with pre-selected programs and features
    Manjaro - relatively-convenient Arch; it detects your hardware and installs the necessary drivers for you
        Big Linux - has a lot of convenient GUI configurations, and an easy way to switch the Desktop Environment
    SteamOS 3 - Steam Deck's OS, used for gaming, runs with KDE Plasma 5 and has a Windows-compatibility layer


Enoch
    Gentoo - Like Arch but somehow more extreme 
        Chromium OS - for people who don't want a computer, just Google Chrome


Alpine - very light and minimalistic (supports run-from-RAM), great for microservices and dockerized server stuff


SuSE Linux - [Software- und System-Entwicklung (Software and Systems Development)]
    OpenSUSE Tumbleweed - rolling versions, but still stable. Can switch flavors easily!  OpenSUSE is meant for IT and productivity (comes with preinstallations)


NixOS - supports a lot of packages. The Nix package manager is available for other distros.


Android
    LineageOS - a privacy-centered fork of CyanogenMod


SELinux - Security Enhanced Linux developed by Red Hat and used by the NSA. Has a complicated user-access system.


Meant to run on media attachments. Lightweight
    Porteus - Works off SD/DVD/USB... Light and fast
    Puppy - Works off SD/DVD/USB...


OpenBSD isn't Linux, but it's still Unix-like. Entirely free and highly secure (network security).





Desktop Environments / flavors: (remember that those can be swapped; those are just system configurations / packages)

    KDE - Stylish/modern, cross-platform. Has a large (well-made) applications bundle. [Kool Desktop Environment]
        KDE Plasma - Has a lot of flare to it.
        KDE Lite - ?
    GNOME - a fork of GTK(+). GNOME 3 is a bit more Mac-like.
        Cinnamon - Stylized, but still decently snappy. A fork of GNOME 3 but the layout is like GNOME 2 (Windows-7 like).
        MATE - Lighter than Cinnamon. The primary continuation of GNOME 2. Looks like Windows Vista.
    Xfce - Minimal on features and with crude graphics, works for weak or old hardware. Based on GTK 3. Looks like flat Windows XP [abbreviation: XForms Common Environment]
    LXQt - lightweight, about the same as Xfce (used to be the lighter, back when LXQt was called LXDE). Built with Qt; relatively new (for better/worse). Looks like an amalgamation of old Windows and Mac, seems to have its own quirks
    Qtile - ?
    i3WM - ?
    Wayfire - ?


Visuals:
GTK - open source toolkits and GUI elements. Everything uses it.
Qt - a cross platform (for every common OS) GUI creator  [pronounced "cute"]
X11 - a display server. Extremely common, very old, somewhat bloated.
Wayland - a relatively new and lighter display server that aims to replace X11. Still not as widely supported as X11 by various programs

File Managers:
Nautilus - built on GNOME 2
Nemo - A fork of Nautilus
Caja - A fork of Nautilus
Dolphin - built on KDE
