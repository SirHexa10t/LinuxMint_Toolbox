Reasons to pick or not pick Audacious:
--------------------------------------
+ Reads all sorts of formats. ogg, wav, mp3, mp4, flac, tta, even midi and flv
-    but can't read them directly from within an archive like Foobar2000. Seems none can. 
- GTK3 and Qt5 UI modes have different missing features. One can't support user-defined keys, and one can't lock windows within GUI, among other problems
+ High quality of audio and 7 playback methods
- No playlist tree/folders
+ Has decent basic tools: Equalizer, basic effects, duplication removal in playlists, open track in file explorer...
+ Sort-of has plugins choice (seems quite limited and I can't see how you can add new components). At least it has the concept of plugins...
+ Basic pane organization
- Some of the plugins (like finding lyrics) just don't work
- Somewhat buggy - you need to press some plugin options twice to make the corresponding menu appear
-    visually moving rows (at least at the start) as they "adjust" themselves insometimes
-    some tracks seem to start after 0.1 seconds of another track that's attempting to start - seems like it doesn't follow the .cue precisely (seems to round up the end?)



Play MIDI files: you'd need to install soundfonts.
Ubuntu based systems come with them by default, you can find them in a path like this:  /usr/share/sounds/sf3/default-GM.sf3


Theme configuration:
I picked a dark (but not black) theme wich white(ish) writing and buttons. My setup at "Qt5 Configuration Tool":
    Style: gtk2     Standard dialogs: Default       Palette: Default
    Icon Theme: Mint-Y-Dark
