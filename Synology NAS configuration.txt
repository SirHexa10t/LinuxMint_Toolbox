# The following was written/tested on a Synology DS1520+,  running DSM 7.1.1

# Hardware specs by model name: (according to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RbAiqWf-mQ )
# [lettr_code][XX][YY]?
# letter_code:   DS: Disk Station , FS: Flash Series (SSD only) , SA: SAS , RS: Rack Station , NVR: Network Video Recorder (has GPU and does video-related workloads)
# XX: max number of drives that the device can potentially support (it's taking 5 extra per expansion port into consideration). It's DANGEROUS to add external drives, as a failed connection could render your externally added drives unusable!
# YY: year that the model was released in
# ?:  +: support for extra software features (docker / VMs, BTRFS) , slim: 2.5" bays version , XS: extra storage (but weaker processing power) , RP: redundant power-supply , J: simplest (doesn't support BTRFS)


# Upgrade your device with an M.2 NVMe SSD for caching. # TODO - find what's the optimal ratio of total storage to cache storage 

# Consider upgrading your RAM if you're using the NAS for applications usage. Also, RAM is used for cache while writing.

# Due to rewrite requirements when running out of space in SMR drives, you should avoid them. Get CMR drives.
#   You might get really good drives by shucking external drives. It's a gamble.


# Choosing RAID:  if you don't know much about RAID, read this: https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/StorageManager/storage_pool_what_is_raid?version=7
# If you have several (4+) drives, you'd want to use SHR (besides, you bought a Synology device, so make use of this option)
#   You can simulate the effect of choosing any specific RAID strategy on this page: https://www.synology.com/en-us/support/RAID_calculator
# In SHR1/SHR2, you can lose up to 1 / 2 drive(s) of largest capacity, accordingly. 10% extra data will be taken away by DSM
#   There are some great advantages to SHR which won't be explained in this file.

# For filesystem, I suggest BTRFS. Won't be explained here either.


Utilities:
----------
Package Center > Install the following:
    Snapshot Replication

Open the NAS to the world
    Port-forward https DSM ports on your router
    Modify the NAS's firewall

# TODO - integrate VPN

# TODO - integrate Docker

# TODO - integrate Pi-Hole
    # Saw someone calling it "pinhole" - is that a variation of it? 
    # Need to check what "unbound" is (works with it)

# TODO - you can access the NAS with DDNS if you setup a Synology account; you can get a subdomain name in .synology.me 

# TODO - torrent downloads?

# TODO - integrate surveillance camera feed

# TODO - might want to use Active Insight (requires account) for problem reports

# TODO - Maybe use Pinhole is nice, make sure to use unbound with it.


Convenience and responsiveness:
-------------------------------
User & Group > Advanced -> make sure you don't have Password Expiration
    Set-up a strong password, don't rely on password expiration.

# TODO - integrate SSH access

Storage Manager
    > HDD/SSD -> right-click the M.2 device "cache device <num>" -> manage [...] > Create SSD cache
        Note: with 1 M.2 device you can only do read-only caching; you need 2 devices for read-write cache


Control Panel
    > Hardware & Power > General > Power Recovery -> Restart automatically after a power failure
        Could cause damage if you encounter another power-out as the device boots
    > File Services > SMB > Advanced Settings
        > General:
            Transport "encryption mode": disabled or "client defined" (SMB has slower encryption than HTTPS. Might be necessary in some cases; speed improvement)
            "server signing": disabled (impersonation prevention; speed improvement)
            "Opportunistic Locking": enabled (keeps a stream open; speed improvement)
            "SMB2 lease": enabled (speed improvement)
            "SMB durable handles" enabled (no need for new connections for new files; speed improvement)
        > Others:
            asyncronous read: enabled (for multiple SMB connections; speed improvement)
    > File Services > SMB > Enable Transfer Log
        don't mark "Read", it'll give you too many logs
    > File Services > Advanced -> Enable file fast clone
        this is a BTRFS feature. Instant copy between 2 places on the same folder. Also, the copy doesn't take any space unless there are changes applied to it
    > Network > Network Interface > Edit (connection) > IPv4 > Set MTU manually: 9000
        Packages the transmission of many small items together 
        # TODO - figure out why it won't allow more than 1500


BTRFS improvements:
    Storage Manager > <Volume> > [*** on the right-side of the volume in the middle of the screen] -> Record File Access Time: Never
        This determines modification on read, which burdens BTRFS with more change-entries per file. You can also set to Monthly; it'd be much better than "Daily".



Security (if it's accessible to the internet)
--------
# TODO - disable user "Admin"

Security > Protection -> Enable auto block
    Put in something like 100 Login attempts every 30 minutes. It'll block brute-force attacks, but not block out users who forgot their password.

Make sure admin account is disabled.

Person (top right corner) > Personal -> Sign-in Method -> Enable 2-Factor Authentication

Login Portal > DSM -> change the DSM port
    Slightly more secure than using the well-known default one.

# TODO - add a regular user that'll be used regularly instead of the initial Admin one



Maintenance and data safety:
----------------------------
HDD/SSD > Task Scheduler
    Make sure you have a monthly S.M.A.R.T tests
    
Storage > <pool> > Schedule Data Scrubbing
    Check for errors (bit-rot) on your disks on off-hours. Every 3 months or so.    

# TODO - use hyper-backup to backup important files to another place

# TODO - If you're using BTRFS, enable Snapshot Replication

# TODO - snapshot replication (BTRFS feature)

# TODO - UPS integration:  Hardware & Power > UPS -> Time before DiskStation enters Safe Mode
    You set x minutes of running on UPS before restart deciding to shut down





Connection:
-----------
Option 1: SMB through terminal (cifs mount)
* On your Linux-PC, install: cifs-utils
* run connection command in this format:   $ sudo mount -t cifs -o username=<username>,password="<password>",uid=$(id -u) //<nas_ip_addr>/<folder_name> <mountpoint>
    # Example:
    username="sam"
    password="iauewsdbfnolisudbflisbdfklbsd"
    nas_address='10.0.0.33'
    folder='homework'
    mountpoint='/nas_mount'

    mkdir "$mountpoint"  # only need to do once. If you needed sudo for your dir choice, you'll also need:   $ sudo chmod 777 "$mountpoint"
    sudo mount -t cifs -o username="$username",password="$password",uid=$(id -u) "//$nas_address/$folder" "$mountpoint"
    cd "$mountpoint" && ls
* when you're done you can unmount with:
    sudo umount "$mountpoint"

Option 2: SMB through File Manager
* Your file manager might haVE A "Network" label at the bottom of your quick-access menu (left side in file-explorer window). Find your NAS there, and enter username and password.

Option 3:
* Drag-and-drop into the web-client


NFS:
* Go to Control Panel > NFS
